			  <h3>Senior Testimonials</h3><br />
			  <p class="content"><img class="testimg" src="SeniorTestimonials1.jpg" />I have really enjoyed the entertainment programs at the Sycamore Senior Center. It’s great to sit with friends and be lifted up by the music. Many of the programs contain music that reminds me of happy times in my life. -Dori V., senior, Sycamore Senior Center</p>
			  <p class="content"><img class="testimg" src="SeniorTestimonials2.jpg" />This is absolutely the kind of stimulation that we need. -B. P., senior</p>

			  <h3>Facility Testimonial</h3>
			  <p class="content"><img class="testimg" src="FacilityTestimonial.jpg">I wanted to compliment Jody Anderson and her husband for the wonderful job they did entertaining residents at Bayley for the Halloween Party. Their interaction and exuberance was catching. Their musical selections were fun, festive and well-received by their audience. They also engaged residents and staff members in the program and encouraged singing, dancing and all- around fun. All who attended truly enjoyed the celebration. Thanks to Creative Aging and their wonderful artists/entertainers who truly care about the people for whom they perform. -Adrienne W., President/CEO, Bayley</p>

			  <h3>Artist Testimonials</h3>
			  <p class="content"><img class="testimg" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" src="ArtistTestimonials1.jpg" />Today we played to a full crowd of wheelchair-bound residents, some of whom were bright-eyed and clapping or singing along or just plain smiling with pleasure at the happy music. It makes it all worthwhile and makes us believe in what we do, making music and sharing stories to displace the heaviest fog of discomfort. There was even some cackling at Russ’s awful stories.  It is SO HARD to frown when a banjo is playing—a real spirit lifter. -Barb C., CAC artist</p>
			  <p class="content"><img class="testimg" src="ArtistTestimonials2.jpg" />I have had some of the most rewarding performances of my career playing for Creative Aging Cincinnati. The senior audiences are thrilled with my music and respond very favorably. They seem to get more out of the music than many other age groups, often moved to tears. I always look forward to their uninhibited and enthusiastic responses! The folks working for CAC are always friendly, efficient and available, too. It is a delight to work with them. -Kyle M., CAC artist</p>
